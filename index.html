            <p>At the top of the page, you’ll see a bar labeled "Enter Movie." Type in the name of the movie you want to add and click "Add Movie", then proced to find your movie bellow undder the A-B-C "Katigory" ;3. If you get a message that says "ERROR: ALREADY EXISTS," that means the movie is already in the system. In that case, scroll down and find your movie under the A-B-C "Katigory". Click on the movie title, and a dropdown will appear where you can give it a cat-tastic review—or take a walk on the wild side and leave a random one instead!
