# Exam-1-Assignment

## Sources Used
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) – to check syntax patterns and DOM manipulation tips
- ChatGPT – for troubleshooting syntax, logic, and generating article summaries
- Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) – to clarify how `Math.round`, `appendChild`, and `event.preventDefault()` work in JavaScript

## Hardest Parts
- Figuring out how to display and update dynamic HTML without reloading the page
- Managing dropdown visibility and connecting it to specific movie entries
- Making sure the average rating calculation always stayed up to date after manual or random inputs
- Keeping the layout and flow beginner-friendly but still functional

## What I Learned
- How to simulate Java methods using front-end JavaScript
- How to detect duplicates and scroll the page dynamically
- How to break code into testable pieces and commit as I go (even the broken ones!)
- That even if you're short on time, with a bit of help and persistence, you can pull off a working project :)

This project was created as part of Exam 1. I started by typing up the base structure and used ChatGPT to help review my code for syntax errors and logic mistakes. With a tight schedule after classes, I relied on GPT to help me get everything cleaned up in time.

I also used GPT to suggest and summarize articles to help me understand each part of the assignment better, especially for planning how to structure the script and execute it cleanly. I wasn’t fully confident in the JavaScript portion at first, so I had GPT assist with implementing the interactive features in the HTML version.

Everything included here has been tested in stages, with comments and iteration to simulate a real development/testingaa process. Broken versions were tested and fixed as part of the learning experience.
